Natural Language Processing Advances. Recent advances in NLP have transformed the field significantly. Transformer architectures and attention mechanisms form the backbone of modern NLP systems. Pre-trained language models like BERT, GPT, and T5 have achieved remarkable performance across various tasks. Few-shot and zero-shot learning capabilities allow models to handle new tasks with minimal examples. Multilingual and cross-lingual models enable processing of multiple languages simultaneously. Applications span chatbots, machine translation, text generation, and document analysis. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) combines knowledge retrieval with text generation. Fine-tuning techniques adapt pre-trained models to specific domains and tasks.
