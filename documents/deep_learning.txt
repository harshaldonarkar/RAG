Deep Learning Fundamentals. Deep learning uses neural networks with multiple layers to learn complex patterns in data. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel at image processing and computer vision tasks. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and LSTMs handle sequential data like time series and text. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) create realistic synthetic data. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) learn compressed representations of data. Optimization techniques like Adam and RMSprop improve training efficiency. Regularization methods prevent overfitting and improve generalization. GPU computing enables training of large-scale models. Batch normalization and dropout are common techniques for stable training.
