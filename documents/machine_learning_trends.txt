Machine Learning Trends 2024. Current trends in machine learning include several key areas. Large Language Models (LLMs) and their applications continue to expand rapidly. Multimodal AI combining text, image, and audio processing is becoming more sophisticated. Federated learning enables privacy-preserving machine learning across distributed devices. AutoML and neural architecture search automate model design and optimization. Edge AI and model compression techniques make AI more accessible on mobile devices. Explainable AI (XAI) provides better interpretability of model decisions. Transfer learning allows models to adapt to new tasks with minimal data. Few-shot and zero-shot learning capabilities are improving significantly.
