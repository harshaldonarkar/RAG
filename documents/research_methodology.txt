Research Methodology in AI. Systematic research methodology is crucial for advancing AI. Literature review identifies existing knowledge and research gaps. Hypothesis formation guides experimental design and investigation. Data collection and preprocessing ensure high-quality training datasets. Experimental design includes proper controls and statistical analysis. Evaluation metrics measure model performance objectively. Cross-validation prevents overfitting to specific datasets. Baseline comparisons establish performance improvements. Reproducibility requires detailed documentation and code sharing. Peer review ensures quality and validity of research findings. Ethical considerations guide responsible AI research practices.
