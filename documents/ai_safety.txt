AI Safety Research Overview. AI safety is a crucial field focused on ensuring artificial intelligence systems behave safely and beneficially. Key areas include alignment, robustness, and interpretability. Recent trends show increased focus on large language model safety, including work on constitutional AI, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and adversarial testing. Major organizations like Anthropic, OpenAI, and DeepMind are leading safety research. Constitutional AI involves training models to follow a set of principles. RLHF uses human feedback to improve model behavior. Adversarial testing helps identify potential failure modes. Research also focuses on value alignment and ensuring AI systems pursue intended goals.
